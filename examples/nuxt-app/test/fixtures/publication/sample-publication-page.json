Each plan focuses on elements of the priorities for targeted actions and recommendations.</p><p>The Victorian Skills Plan for 2022 into 2023 (Victorian Skills Plan 2022) contained 11 actions and 36 initiatives to be implemented across industry, education providers and the VSA in the following three years to address priorities in skills provision. </p><p>The 25 initiatives scheduled to start in year one are well underway. </p><p>The remaining 11 initiatives have staggered start dates and the VSA will provide further updates through future skills plans. </p><h3 id=\"implementation-update\">Implementation update</h3><p>This implementation update covers the first year actions and initiatives, and highlights the plan’s role in prioritising and directing the VSA’s work program and collaboration approach with key stakeholders and partners including the:</p><ul><li>Department of Education</li><li>Department of Jobs, Skills, Industry and Regions</li><li>Office of TAFE Coordination and Delivery.</li></ul><p>It also highlights the VSA’s place-based engagement processes as well as its role in leading national vocational education and training (VET) reform and supporting key government priorities.  </p><h3 id=\"key-themes\">Key themes</h3><p>The actions and initiatives underpinning the Victorian Skills Plan 2022 are based on three key themes.</p><h4>1. Promoting post-secondary education skills and career pathways</h4><p>All Victorians should be able to access education and training at the level that suits their circumstances and at any point in their lives. Success rests in understanding and responding to the learning needs and aspirations of Victorians.</p><h4>2. Lifting participation in education and training</h4><p>Too many Victorians are still excluded from education and training and therefore good jobs. Access to quality and relevant learning for work and life is critical.</p><h4>3. Delivering the right skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow</h4><p>Local and global factors will require workers to up-skill and develop transferable skills, allowing flexibility within and across occupations and industries to meet skills demand and increase productivity. </p><p>This requires a skills and training system that is responsive to current and future skills needs and has strong connections with industry to ensure it has the capacity and capability for innovation. </p>"
