  Scenario: Default social share links are respected
    Given the site endpoint returns fixture "/site/reference" with status 200

    Given I visit the page "/"
    Then the sidebar component with ID "tide-sidebar-social-share" should exist
    And the sidebar social share links should display as follows
      | link                 | visible |
      | Facebook             | true    |
