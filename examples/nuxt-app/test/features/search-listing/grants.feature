  @mockserver

    Given the page endpoint for path "/grants" returns fixture "/search-listing/grants/page" with status 200
    And the search network request is stubbed with fixture "/search-listing/grants/response" and status 200
    And the current date is "Fri, 02 Feb 2050 03:04:05 GMT"

    Then the search listing page should have 3 results
    And the search listing layout should be "list"
    And the search network request should be called with the "/search-listing/grants/request" fixture
    And the grant search listing results should have following items:
      | title                                    | url                                                                        | updated               | content                                                                                                                                               | audience                                         | amount            | status                    |
