Feature: Grants collection

  As a user I can search for grants and filter them by status

  Background:
    Given the endpoint "/api/tide/site" with query "?id=8888" returns fixture "/site/reference" with status 200
    And the search autocomplete request is stubbed with "/search-listing/suggestions/none" fixture
    And I am using a "macbook-16" device

  @mockserver
  Example: Results formatting
    Given the endpoint "/api/tide/page" with query "?path=/grants&site=8888" returns fixture "/search-listing/grants/page" with status 200
    And the search network request is stubbed with fixture "/search-listing/grants/response" and status 200
    And the current date is "Fri, 02 Feb 2050 03:04:05 GMT"
    When I visit the page "/grants"
    Then the search listing page should have 2 results
    And the search listing layout should be "list"
    And the search network request should be called with the "/search-listing/grants/request" fixture
    And the grant search listing results should have following items:
      | title                                | url                                 | updated             | content                                                                                                                                            | audience                          | amount            | status                    |
