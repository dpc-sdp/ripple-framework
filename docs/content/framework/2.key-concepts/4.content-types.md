Content types are a Drupal concept that allow for modelling content using fields to describe the data structure. See the [Drupal documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/understanding-drupal/content-types) for more details.

## Ripple content types

As SDP is a [headless CMS using a decoupled architecture](https://salsa.digital/insights/dissecting-the-single-digital-presence-platform) once we have modelled content in Tide, we need a way to render it into a template that can be delivered to end users. Ripple content types allow you to support custom templates for new content types. 

Ripple content types consist of the following parts:

### API Mapping

See [API Endpoints](/framework/key-concepts/api-endpoints) for more information the Tide API translation layer. For each content type we supply a function that maps the Tide Drupal API response into more concise fields that match the data needed for  

### Template

To render the page using Ripple UI components, we need to create a Vue component that is passed the data from the API request and, using Ripple UI components, creates a layout that matches your intended design.


> See the [Content type guide](/framework/guides/creating-content-types) for more information on creating new content types.


## Core content types

In Tide we have a number of content types which are part of the core distribution and are initially included in SDP sites
