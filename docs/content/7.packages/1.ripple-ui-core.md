# Ripple UI Core

This package house all the commonly used UI components and the base styles for the Ripple UI design system.


## Package structure

Previously in Ripple 1.x, each component was a seperate NPM package. In practice no projects were used this way. If a project only wants to import specific components they will be tree shaken to remove usused code by most modern bundlers.
