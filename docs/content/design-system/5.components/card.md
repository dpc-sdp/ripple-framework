## Usage
Use cards to help users find the right information quickly.

They can combine a variety of content, including text, media and links.

Cards are best used on a landing page to highlight any related pages, events or ongoing campaigns.

Ensure headings are direct and summaries are concise.

### How this component works
Cards can be made up of: 
- metadata, to show supplementary data to give the user more information (for example, date, topic, status, etc.) 
- headline, to provide a snapshot of the content
- summary, to provide further details
- visual elements, to provide visual prominence.

You only need a headline and a summary for a card. All other elements are optional and will depend on a user's needs.

#### Metadata
All cards have optional metadata. Use metadata to display a combination of:
- topic/tag - categories for when a user needs to group content (for example, departments, agencies, services, etc.)
- date - how old the content is, for when this information is important to the user
- status - where a component or action is sitting within a process.

#### Visual elements
Visual elements in cards allow for different content to stand out. They can also provide additional context.

Elements that can provide visual prominence include:
- an image
- a highlight border
- a blocked headline type.

Use visual elements carefully. Only use a visual element if it:
- is meaningful to the user journey
- supports what is already in the content
- can help the user differentiate content from other content
- can be easily identified
- is informative and not only decorative.

### When and how to use
- Group together cards with similar content.
- Use only a single style of card within a set of cards.
- Keep the content clear and concise.
- Only use one piece of information per card.

### When and how not to use
- Don't mix different card variants in a group.
- Never use a single card only.
- Never repeat content in a group of cards.
- Don't overload cards with content.
- Don't include other interactive elements, like links, inside the card.
