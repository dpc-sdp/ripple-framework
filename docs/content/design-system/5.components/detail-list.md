## Usage

Use the detail list to display a list with labels. This surfaces (retrieves and displays) and highlights key information to users.

Each row of the detail list comprises a:
- label, a descriptive or informative label for your content, for example, 'Location'
- content, the piece of information itself, for example, 'East Gippsland'.

The detail list is used to display:
- metadata, for example, ‘Published date' (which shows as '22 March 2023’)
- status, for example of a program or grant.

Only use the detail list for simple information. For data or complex information, consider using a table.
