## Usage
The Header status draws attention to key information or data relevant to the page. 

The header status can display content like:
- the progress toward completion of a set of actions (such as recommendations from a royal commission or inquiry) 
- the status or closing date of a job listing or grant application 

The status bar updates dynamically based on its data set. The status bar completeness value can go left-to-right or right-to-left depending on data requirements. 

The Header status must be used at the top of a page within the header section.

## Theming

Header status uses colour to add prominence to the status. It also adopts theming from the [button](/design-system/components/button/) component.

If you choose the neutral button for your site, the header site search will display buttons in the neutral theme.
