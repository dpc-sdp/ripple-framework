## Usage
The Status indicator shows a user the current status of an ongoing process. 

It can be used for displaying information such as:

- the completion status of a set of recommendations or project milestones to be implemented
- the status or closing date of a job application or grant application.

The Status indicator will update dynamically based on its dataset. The Status indicator can show progression from right to left or left to right, depending on data requirements.
