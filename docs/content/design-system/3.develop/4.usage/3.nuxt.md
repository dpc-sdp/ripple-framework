First, set up [access to Github Packages](access-to-github-packages).

Next, install Ripple UI in your project:

`npm install @dpc-sdp/ripple-ui-core --save`

Ripple UI exports a nuxt module that you can add to your nuxt config, note the addition of `/nuxt`:

```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@dpc-sdp/ripple-ui-core/nuxt'
  ]
})
```

In order for the styles to appear correctly, you will need to import them. Do this at the root of your project (usually in your app.vue file):

```js
import '@dpc-sdp/ripple-ui-core/style';
import '@dpc-sdp/ripple-ui-core/style/components';
```

There is no need to import the components as they will be registered globally by the nuxt module

```js
<template>
  <RplButton variant="outlined" />
</template>
```

Even if you are not using SDP, the [Ripple Framework documentation](/framework) is a good starting point for any Nuxt development using Ripple.
