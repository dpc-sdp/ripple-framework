NPM allows the use of multiple repo hosts, as long as they can be identified by namespace.

Ripple 2 is hosted publicly on Github Packages (ghcr) under the **@dpc/sdp** namespace, so a few steps need to be followed access these packages, while also co-existing with the npm ecosystem.

First, create a Personal Access Token on Github:

1. Visit https://github.com/settings/tokens and select **Generate new token** > **Generate new token (classic)**

::DocsImageExample

src: /img/generate.jpg
alt: "Screenshot of a clicked button (title Generate new token) that has opened a drop-down menu with two options: fine-grained and classic"
style: "width:360px"
---
::

2. Fill in the **Note** and choose an **Expiration** - the 30 day default is generally fine, you'll receive a reminder to regenerate the token just before expiry

src: /img/token.jpg
alt: "Screenshot of personal access token setup form, with 'Note' filled in as 'public ghcr access' and 'Expiration' set to default of 30 days"
style: "width:505px"
---
::

3. Set the scope to only allow `read:packages`, and **Generate** token

::DocsImageExample
---
src: /img/permissions.jpg
alt: "Screenshot of scope, with only read:packages selected"
style: "width:827px"
---
::

4. Store the resulting token somewhere secure, and add it to either a user `.npmrc` (recommended) or the project-level `.npmrc` (the url on line 2 below is protocol-less, not a comment):

```
@dpc-sdp:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=<github personal access token>
```
