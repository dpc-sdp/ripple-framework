Modular kindergartens are an efficient solution for delivering quality buildings in short timeframes. They are constructed in a factory in sections known as “modules”. These modules are delivered to the kindergarten site, where builders assemble them, connect utilities and complete outdoor areas. Constructing the modules offsite minimises disruptions to the community and kindergarten. The process also reduces the time required for a traditional build and gives children faster access to high-quality learning environments.

The precinct creates new ways to champion excellence in learning and teaching. It creates new opportunities for students at every stage of education. It will provide a seamless path from early learning to adult education, making education more accessible for the Footscray community than ever before. As part of the precinct, we're building an integrated early learning centre – a community hub offering kindergarten as well as a range of health and wellbeing services for local families. We're also upgrading and modernising local primary schools, and we've created a new high school with three campuses. The Footscray Learning Precinct includes: Footscray High School Pilgrim Year 7–9 Campus Barkly Year 7–9 Campus Kinnear Year 10–12 Campus Footscray City Primary School Footscray Primary School Footscray Learning Precinct – Billy Button Children's Centre Community engagement In November 2016, over four weeks, the VSBA ran community engagement activities to ensure they had opportunities to express support or concerns about the proposed concept before the feasibility study was finalised. We found there was a high level of support for the proposed concept. Throughout August 2017, we engaged with local students, teachers, parents and community members to ensure that their hopes, aspirations and concerns were identified and included in the design of the Footscray Learning Precinct. Community feedback was provided to Hayball architects to help them develop a master plan for the precinct. You can access both of the above mentioned engagement reports by contacting us.  Explore further For more information on learning programs and partnerships this precinct is delivering, please visit the Department of Education.
